              user     system      total        real
        
The number of compound words in list: 97107

Largest compound words (letter length):

Design
  Trie (prefix tree) is built from the dictionary given to enable fast
search times. The compound word search uses the trie to determine valid
words from the dictionary.
  The advantage of using a trie is for very fast dictionary word
lookup times. The disadvantage of creating a trie for search is slow 
loading dictionary times from disk to memory and trie representation 
memory usage.

Implementation

  Trie representation
  To represent and quickly search all the words in a given dictionary, 
a trie (prefix tree) is built. The trie.rb file contains two classes 
to represent the trie, a Node class and a Trie class. The Node class 
contains it's letter and it's children nodes. The Node's == operator 
is overloaded to make node to node equality simple, based on the 
letter in the node. The Trie class contains a root node used to access 
the trie and a build_trie method used to construct the tree from all 
dictionary words. When building the trie, a null node is used to 
denote end of whole words.

  Search
  Each word is then searched letter-by-letter for compoundness using 
the trie through a combination of null node markers and recursive
calls on word substrings, removing dictionary word prefixes.
