# Main 
#
# Write a program that reads a file containing a sorted list of words (one
# word per line, no spaces, all lower case), then identifies the longest
# word in the file that can be constructed by concatenating copies of
# shorter words also found in the file.
#
# For example, if the file contained:
#
#       cat
#       cats
#       catsdogcats
#       catxdogcatsrat
#       dog
#       dogcatsdog
#       hippopotamuses
#       rat
#       ratcatdogcat
#
# The answer would be 'ratcatdogcat' - at 12 letters, it is the longest
# word made up of other words in the list.  The program should then
# go on to report how many of the words in the list can be constructed 
# of other words in the list.
